4. Go into Video Settings -> Change Window Mode to Fullscreen in window
5. Start the Jar File -> Ready to use (A gui is opened)
6. Read Tips for better Settings

Tips:
- Do not set foc too high, the cheat will have a high reaction time. (Active Debug to see your CPU time/tps, you should hava over ~30 TPS)
- Set max TPS not under you FPS Limit, it will lag.
- Click "Load Weapon Config" and select your weapon at weapon change, for optimal settings.
- Use Triggerbot only in combination with Aimbot.
- Set sensitivity multiplier rifle scope to 1.
- The Mouse Speed setting is scaling with you mouse sensity, so you need to find your perfect settings by yourself.
